In the first robbery, a Chinese victim was defrauded of 5 million baht. Two Chinese suspects fled with the cash after a failed cryptocurrency exchange. The second robbery took place at the G-Tower on Rama 9 Road and involved four Chinese suspects. The police recovered the money from a property in Sathon district, but the suspects remain at large. In both incidents, the victims were lured into meetings arranged by a middleman for the purpose of converting their cash into cryptocurrency. The transactions were supposed to involve a third party, another Chinese national,"

Solana's consensus mechanism is based on the Byzantine Generals Problem and relies on PoH (Proof of History). Solana can reach 50,000 transactions per second, making it one of the fastest blockchains in the industry. The network's TPS is around 5,000, but this might change in the future. The main concerns of the blockchain are high throughput and low transaction times, but these should not be the only important aspects of a network. The biggest challenge for both Solana and Ethereum is scalability."
