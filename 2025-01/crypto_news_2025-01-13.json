Industry watchers say positive economic data, including last week's jobs report, and bond market activity is putting downward pressure on the risky crypto market. Bitcoin's value broke the $100,000 mark for the first time in early December and flirted with $110,000 later in the month. The digital token ended the year up over 100% for the year, with about half of that gain realized after Trump's election victory in early November."
