Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., sent a letter to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to ask about an allegation made by whistleblowers regarding Operation Choke Point 2.0. She asked FDIC to preserve all materials related to the agency's crypto activities from Jan. 1, 2022, including electronic data, communications, documents and metadata that'may be responsive to the Senate Banking Committee's oversight prerogatives in the coming months' She warned she will make criminal referrals to the Department of Justice if the FDIC destroyed materials. The FDIC has yet to issue a statement."
