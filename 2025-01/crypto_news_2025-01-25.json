The money-laundering probe into a Chinese fraud led to one of the world's biggest ever Bitcoin seizures. It's worth more than the amount raised annually by the cut to winter fuel payments, the VAT raid on private school fees and the hated family farm tax combined. It was in accounts controlled by the Government after it was seized from online wallets controlled by former Chinese takeaway worker Jian Wen, who was jailed for six years for money laundering."
