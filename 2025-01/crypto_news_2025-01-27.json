He argued that eliminating taxes on cryptocurrency gains could encourage innovation, attract investment and position the US as a global leader in the crypto space. Eric Trump isn't an elected official, so his comments don't carry the weight of formal policy. It's unclear how much support the idea would have in Congress. Cryptocurrency taxation is currently a complex issue in the US, with the IRS treating it as property."
