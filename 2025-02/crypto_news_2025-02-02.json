            "summary": "DeepSeek AI software sold for nearly US$1 trillion in market capitalization in China during the Year of the Snake. Louis-Vincent Gave argues that the mainstream media has overlooked the fact that the Chinese economy has leapfrogged the West in engineering and increasingly in technology.
