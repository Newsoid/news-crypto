He has been trying to recover it for a decade but was refused access to excavate the area. Last month a High Court judge threw out his case against the local council to allow him to access the site or receive £495m in compensation. Council plans to close the landfill in the 2025-26 financial year and turn the site into a solar farm to power the council's new bin lorries. Mr Howells is considering buying the entire site to find the hard drive."
