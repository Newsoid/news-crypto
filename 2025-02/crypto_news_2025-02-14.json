            "summary": "James Howells, 39, lost his hard drive containing £620 million in Bitcoin at a rubbish tip in 2013. He offered to share the fortune with Newport City Council, but they refused to let him search the site. The council argued the refuse became their property upon entering the landfill. They recently announced plans to close the site in 2025-26 to build a solar farm. Mr Howells is considering buying the landfill outright."
