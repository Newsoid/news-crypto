He recommended investing in $Libra, a new cryptocurrency that he presented as part of a project to finance small entrepreneurs. The scam was consummated and the few who had bought seconds before his post at a bargain price fled with their profits and left a trail of victims. There are requests for impeachment in Congress and legal proceedings corner the president. He faces an investigation for alleged fraud and 'criminal conspiracy'"
