Union Pacific executives created elaborate structures to defraud taxpayers and bilk the government out of $40+ million. They used shell companies to inflate costs and then funneled the excess cash into their own pockets. They also took care of their political friends, bribing members of Congress with stock grants and huge dividend checks. The whole thing was swept under the rug and one of the key players, James Garfield, even went on to become President. Modern politicians have heeded this lesson well. The Government Accountability Office estimated that up to $500 BILLION of taxpayers funds are wasted"
