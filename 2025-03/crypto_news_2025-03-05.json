Bakkt bought Apex's crypto operations in 2022 for up to $200 million, but it's now expected to cost less than half due to unmet targets. The potential deal reflects crypto industry shifts, with Apex exiting crypto amid Biden-era scrutiny and now eyeing a return under a Trump administration."

Gan filed a lawsuit last month against two of the company's largest investors, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and SoftBank's Vision Fund, accusing them of blocking critical financing efforts to protect their own stakes. The defendants dismissed the lawsuit as baseless. With mounting debt and a looming financial deadline, the company faces the possibility of bankruptcy unless a resolution is found soon."

They discussed the nature of money and why the US government is always in debt. Today, in the face of misguided austerity measures proposed by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), Stephen's message is more urgent than ever. Government borrowing, spiraling national debt, and the accompanying tax burden on the American people are not the result of overspending on public services, but of the privatization of the money supply."
