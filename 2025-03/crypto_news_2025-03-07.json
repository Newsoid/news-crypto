Donald Trump is not considering pardoning Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer convicted for his role in the death of George Floyd. Ben Shapiro, founder of the Daily Wire, this week launched an online petition calling for Trump to pardon Chauvin. Chauvin knelt on top of Floyd's neck for nine and a half minutes as he lay on a Minneapolis sidewalk in May 2020. George Floyd died after being stopped by Chauvin during a May 25, 2020 traffic stop in Minneapolis."
