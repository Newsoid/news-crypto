The liquidation happened during a period of heightened market instability, partly driven by global trade tensions. The European Union's recent retaliatory tariffs have caused uncertainty, affecting both crypto and traditional financial markets. Ether has been in a steep decline since Dec. 16, 2024, when it peaked above $4,100. It has since lost over 53% of its value."

The case dates back to December 2020, when the SEC accused Ripple of selling XRP as an unregistered security, allegedly raising $1.3 billion. In August 2024, a judge ruled that XRP was not a security in programmatic sales on exchanges but upheld penalties for institutional sales. Ripple has donated $45 million to the crypto-focused political action committee Fairshake and $5 million in XRP to President Donald Trump's inauguration fund."
