Institutional investors with $100 million or more in assets under management have invested $38.7 billion in spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The creation of the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve in early March disappointed crypto investors who were expecting the U.S. government to announce a new Bitcoin buying spree. Global crypto adoption is happening faster than in the United States."
