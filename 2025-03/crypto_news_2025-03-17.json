In February, he promoted $LIBRA, a cryptocurrency with no substantive uses except for speculation. The creators of the currency sold off everything 45 minutes after the president's post, pocketing $100 million dollars and crashing the coin's value. The Peronist opposition is trying to leverage the scandal to hurt the political prospects of Milei's party La Libertad Avanza."
