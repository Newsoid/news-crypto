Dr. Reed believes Donald Trump's shift from a sceptic to an advocate of cryptocurrencies is due to the mainstream adoption of cryptocurrencies. Trump's administration should focus on providing clear guidance on the classification of cryptocurrencies and streamlining the licensing process for cryptocurrency businesses. The EU's MiCAR framework is useful, but the U.S. should avoid some aspects of it."
