DeFi was intended to be borderless and inclusive, offering banking services to those outside the formal banking sector. Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations are necessary to provide legitimacy to the DeFi ecosystem, to avert anti-money laundering (AML), and to safeguard investors. KYC is a regulatory system aimed at confirming the identity of individuals involved in financial transactions. Some people worry that KYC would take away from DeFi its essence: anonymity, permissionlessness, and decentralization."
