Amy Miller is based in Mae Sot, Thailand, just over the border from the cybercrime hubs. Matthew Hogan, a detective with Connecticut State Police and an officer on the Secret Service Financial Crimes Task Force, said the scammers in Burma were working on a variety of frauds, including romance scams and duping bank customers over the phone. The biggest growth was in long-term scams known as 'pig butchering,' which involved luring people into fake cryptocurrency investments."
