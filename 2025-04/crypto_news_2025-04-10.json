Atkins has personal stakes of up to $1 million in two crypto firms Securitize and Anchorage Digital and a $1 to $5 million investment in a crypto fund. His appointment coincides with speculation that the \"Magnificent 7\" - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla - could soon embrace stablecoins. New York Attorney General Letitia James urged Congress on April 9 to pass a federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies."

            "summary": "The recent tariff-induced cryptocurrency market rout has sparked comparisons with the March 2020 COVID-19 crash. Bitcoin tanked about 8% from over $81,000 to about $74,500 early on Monday amid tariff panic. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization tanked by nearly 40% from almost $224 billion to $135 billion on March 13, 2020. However, Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs only sparked a 3.5% decline from nearly $2.8 trillion to $ 2.6 trillion."
