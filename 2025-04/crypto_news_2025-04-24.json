The 2023 rule that required banks to get a formal 'nonobjection' approval was also scrapped."

Miners race to crack cryptographic challenges with sophisticated computers. They get cryptocurrency as a reward for time, effort, and electricity. The more resources you contribute to the computing pool, the higher your opportunity to mine a block."

It's a cryptographic puzzle that lots of computational effort is required to solve, but it is easy to verify for anyone else. It makes it virtually impossible to tamper with the blockchain and ensures that once a block is committed to the chain, it's set in history. It also consumes a lot of electricity."
