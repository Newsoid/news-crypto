The latest incident unfolded in broad daylight in Paris, where a masked gang attempted to abduct the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO of prominent French cryptocurrency firm Paymium, from a public street. In January, the co-founder of another leading French crypto company, Ledger, and his wife were brutally kidnapped. In May, the father of a crypto company head was snatched. Both kidnapped fathers tragically suffered the amputation of a finger. Law enforcement agencies across Europe are investigating several of these cases."
