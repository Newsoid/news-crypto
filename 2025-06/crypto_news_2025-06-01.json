Fortune recently broke the story of criminals stealing the personal data of thousands of customers of the crypto exchange. At the centre of the leak was a small Texas-based BPO called TaskUs, which operated customer services to Coinbase at a low cost by employing Indians in customer care centres like the one they had in Indore. TaskUs laid off 226 of its employees working for Coinbase from its Indore service centre. The BPO workers in India were bribed by teenage hackers."
