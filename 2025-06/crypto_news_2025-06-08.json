The Commission condemned the ongoing online promotions and presale activities surrounding the digital asset, saying that neither the coin nor its promoters are registered to operate within Nigeria's capital market framework. According to the Commission, early investigations reveal $Pun is a 'meme coin' — a type of cryptocurrency often created as a joke or internet trend."
