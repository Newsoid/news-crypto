The BRICS summit in Brazil went in the opposite direction to the United States on climate change, committing to \"intensify global efforts to contain global warming\". China's Central Commission for Financial and Economic Affairs issued a directive to crack down on overcapacity and \"disorderly competition\" in solar power. In the US, Trump announced a 50 per cent tariff on imports of copper. This will make it virtually impossible for manufacturers in the US to compete with China in high-tech manufacturing."
