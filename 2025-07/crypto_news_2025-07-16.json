The retreat followed a procedural setback in the U.S. House of Representatives, where lawmakers unexpectedly blocked debate on a trio of bills intended to establish a regulatory framework for digital assets. Trump announced he had secured support from a key bloc of Republican lawmakers, potentially paving the way for a vote on the GENIUS Act."

            "summary": "Donald Trump brokered a deal with conservative House Republicans to revive long-awaited crypto bills. It followed a failed procedural vote in the House earlier in the day, when 13 hard-line GOP members joined Democrats to block debate on the legislation. The move sparked panic in markets and tanked crypto-linked stocks. Bitcoin price saw a straight dip to $116k levels from trading over $120K amid the fallout. The House will now consider three major industry-backed crypto bills this week."
