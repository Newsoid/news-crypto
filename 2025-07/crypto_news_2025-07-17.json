It's the second time the House has approved a crypto market structure bill after a similar bipartisan effort in the previous congressional session last year. This year the Senate is serious about its own passage of a bill. The Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21) saw 208 Republicans and 71 Democrats vote in favor. 216 Republicans and 78 Democrats voted in favor of this year's version of FIT21. On Thursday, the House also passed the Genius Act, which would outline how stablecoin issuers would operate in the US."
