The industry is littered with high-profile casualties, such as Deadrop, which abruptly closed its doors earlier this year and Ember Sword, an MMORPG that once claimed over $200 million in pledges, announced it was out of money and shutting down in May 2025. The future of crypto gaming lies in Play-to-Own (P2O), a more durable and player-centric model. P2O is the natural evolution of digital gaming economies."
