It stipulates that any entity issuing or offering fiat-backed stablecoins to retail users in Hong Kong must obtain a license from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA). The first batch of licenses is expected to be issued in early 2026. The HKMA has opened the application process for stablecoin licenses, with the first round of submissions due by September 30. The ordinance is considered one of the world's most stringent stablecoin regimes, triggering heated debate among Web3 project teams and communities."
