            "summary": "The SEC and Ripple Labs Inc. have formally closed their legal dispute, filing to end their respective appeals in the case over the sale of XRP tokens. The SEC sued Ripple in December 2020, alleging the company and two of its executives conducted an unregistered securities offering by selling XRP, the world's third-largest crypto by market capitalization. Ripple denied the allegations, arguing that XRP is not a security. In June, Ripple agreed to pay a $125 million civil penalty to the U.S. Treasury."
