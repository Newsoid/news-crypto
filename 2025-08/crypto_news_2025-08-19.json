Stablecoins are digital tokens that can be traded near their $1 par value because they are backed by real dollars or safe assets held in reserve. They operate on decentralized blockchains where transactions are recorded on public ledgers maintained by distributed computer networks that span the globe. They circulate freely between digital wallets whose owners can be located anywhere in the world and use pseudonyms. Some estimates forecast that as much as $1.75 trillion in new dollar- backed stablecoins could enter circulation over the next three years. China's leadership views these developments with considerable apprehension."
