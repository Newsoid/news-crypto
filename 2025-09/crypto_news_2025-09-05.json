            "summary": "Three major bills recently passed the US House that give crypto much-needed regulatory clarity. The CLARITY Act lays out the rules of the road regarding which cryptos are securities and which are commodities. This is a game-changer for crypto. Now that we have clear rules, we're about to see a new wave of crypto adoption and institutional money flooding in. This will have a trickle-down effect on everyday investors like you and me. Tokenization is the process of creating a digital representation of a real-word asset on a blockchain. It's already 'game on' for tokenized stocks."

In 2023, a judge ruled that XRP sold on public exchanges wasn't a security, so exchanges relisted the token and trading volumes exploded. In 2025, Ripple Labs paid a $125 million fine for its early sales to institutions, which gave XRP a clear legal status in the United States. Big-name asset managers are scrambling to get their spot XRP ETF applications in front of the SEC, and experts think there's a 95% chance of approval by late"
