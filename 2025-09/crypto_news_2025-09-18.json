The 12-foot-tall figure was made from hard foam and finished in gold and placed on 3rd Street just off Union Square on the National Mall. It was funded and erected by a group of cryptocurrency investors linked to memecoin projects. Organizers said the installation was not only a work of political art but also a commentary on monetary policy, deliberately unveiled on the same day the Federal Reserve announced a quarter-point reduction in its benchmark interest rate."
