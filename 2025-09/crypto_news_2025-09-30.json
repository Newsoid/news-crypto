Qian masterminded a large-scale investment scam that specifically targeted older investors, with victims typically aged between 50 and 75 years. Qian fled China using falsified documentation before entering the United Kingdom, where she attempted to launder stolen funds through property acquisitions. Jian Wen, a Chinese takeaway worker, was sentenced to six years and eight months' imprisonment for money laundering offences."
