Cardano is trading at near $0.89 and has regained momentum. ADA has had a strong recovery from its lows and now has stabilised just under the important $1 level. If the market continues to remain bullish, ADA has the potential to retest levels of $1.20-$1.30 if it manages to secure a firm break above resistance at $1, provided the market stays bullish. MAGACOin FINANCE is generating hype reminiscent of Solana's early explosive growth."

            "summary": "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced on Friday that the department is reviewing a proposal to issue a one-dollar coin bearing the image of President Donald Trump to mark the nation's 250th anniversary. Brandon Peach released preliminary design drafts on the social media platform X. One draft features Trump's portrait on the front, while the reverse shows him raising his fist in front of an American flag with the words 'Fight, Fight, Fight.' The initiative stems from legislation signed by Trump in 2020 during his presidency, which authorized the Treasury to issue commemorative coins to commemorate the anniversary."
