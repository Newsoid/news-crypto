Bitcoin's new uptrend fits a seasonal pattern called 'Uptober', which usually produces big gains for cryptocurrencies in the past years. The recent rise in Bitcoin's value is the result of the favorable macro environment, steeper institutional inflows and on-chain supply constraints. Early-stage investors are interested in MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project that raised over $15.5 million and analysts expect a 50x upside."
