Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the men were the 'masterminds' behind 'horrific scam centres' that used force labour in Cambodia and Myanmar to trick victims across the world. Chen is said to have built casinos and compounds used as scam centres, as well as laundering the proceeds. His UK assets include a £12 million mansion near Primrose Hill, in London, and 10 Fenchurch Street, an office building in the City of London bought through one of his companies for £95 million in 2020."
