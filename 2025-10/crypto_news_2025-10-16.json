In August, it had picked up to 2.9%, the highest rate since January. Food, used cars, and trucks were the main causes, but energy also increased for the first time in seven months. Inflation is a measure of how much goods increase in value over time. When the price of goods outstrips wages, this can be bad, as people can purchase fewer things, and this harms the economy. Liquid assets like Bitcoin are more vulnerable to inflation."
