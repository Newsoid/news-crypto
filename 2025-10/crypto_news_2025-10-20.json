The collateral is typically locked by the provider until the debt is repaid. LTV (Loan-to-Value ratio) is a metric that shows the relation between the loan amount and the current value of the collateral. Most platforms that offer crypto-backed loans set upper LTV limits. When the ratio reaches this level, the platform liquidates the collateral to avoid losses."
