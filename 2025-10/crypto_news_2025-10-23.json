This is due to a deeper structural shift in the global economy, governments rolling over debt for longer periods, business cycles stretching out, and liquidity waves moving through the system more slowly. Central banks stop tightening, it takes 6-12 months for liquidity to reach markets. China's money supply is now over 2 times that of the U.S., and it keeps expanding. Institutional demand is steady, and retail interest hasn't peaked."
