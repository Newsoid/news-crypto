Its holdings are worth roughly $71 billion at Bitcoin $112,000. Its capital structure is financed through: $7.5 billion in convertible debt, $730 million in preferreds, $500 million in 10% 'Strife' preferreds (STRF), and a shrinking software business that no longer generates sustainable free cash flow. Short-seller Jim Chanos compares MicroStrategy's valuation premium to SPACs. Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) collapsed in 1998 under the same combination of leverage, liquidity and reflexivity."
