Its holdings are worth roughly $71 billion at Bitcoin $112,000. Its capital structure is financed through: $7.5 billion in convertible debt, $730 million in preferreds, $500 million in 10% 'Strife' preferreds (STRF), and a shrinking software business that no longer generates sustainable free cash flow. Short-seller Jim Chanos compares MicroStrategy's valuation premium to SPACs. Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) collapsed in 1998 under the same combination of leverage, liquidity and reflexivity."

            "summary": "Jason Donnelly, the vice president and treasury management relationship manager III at First Mid Bank and Trust, gave a presentation in Lumpkin Hall on Oct 21. He explained the various types of fraud that can impact college students. The most common type of fraud is ACH fraud, which consists of unauthorized transfers from bank accounts and check fraud. About half of U.S. adults report having fallen victim to this fraud. Paul Brown, the assistant chair for administration and a faculty member in business analytics and information systems, said this is due to the fact that younger generations tend to do their online work."
