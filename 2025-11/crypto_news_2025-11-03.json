A 13-second video taken the night of the kidnapping was entered as an exhibit in the guilty plea of one of the kidnappers last month. Pleter's investors forced him into a bankruptcy proceeding to try to recover more than $40 million they gave him to invest in cryptocurrency and foreign currencies. A few days before the kidnapping, Akyer met Pleter at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in downtown Toronto to gain his trust. A trial for the other two kidnappers is set for January."
