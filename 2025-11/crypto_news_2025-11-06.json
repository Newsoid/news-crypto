The fine related to faults in the configuration of the transaction monitoring system, which resulted in more than 30 million transactions worth over 176 billion euros not being properly monitored over a 12-month period. It took almost three years to fully complete the monitoring of the affected transactions, leading to the reporting of 2,708 suspicious transactions to the authorities for further analysis and potential investigation."
