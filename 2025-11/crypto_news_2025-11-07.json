            "summary": "Since 2022, the network's transition to a deflationary model has steadily reduced the supply of Ether (ETH). In contrast, XRP (XRP) has carved out a distinct role as a bridge asset, facilitating instant cross-border liquidity for banks and global payment networks. If ETH's deflationary rate slows, its scarcity advantage could weaken. Such a reversal could reshape the dynamics of the cryptocurrency sector. It could influence institutional adoption, payment systems and market valuations."
