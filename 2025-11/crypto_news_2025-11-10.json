            "summary": "Quantum computing has the potential to destroy the foundation of today's digital world. Every digital service we use today, from online banking and WhatsApp to cloud storage and e-governance platforms relies on encryption. Once quantum computers become powerful enough, they could easily crack the encryption systems that protect most of the world's data including RSA and ECC encryption, which secure your bank transactions, online passwords, and government databases. The current cybersecurity systems will effectively collapse overnight."

It has been used in traditional finance for decades, particularly in index fund investing. DCA is relevant in the crypto market due to its extreme volatility and cyclical nature. It's effective because it spreads exposure over time. It also reduces emotional trading and promotes long-term thinking."
